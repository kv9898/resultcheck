Description:
    Lightweight helpers for checking whether empirical results remain 
    substantively unchanged across code revisions, platform differences, 
    and package updates. The package supports regression-style testing of 
    derived datasets, statistical model outputs, tables, and plots, helping 
    researchers detect unintended result drift early and distinguish material 
    from non-material changes in empirical workflows.
