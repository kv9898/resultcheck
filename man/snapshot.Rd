\item{value}{The R object to snapshot (e.g., plot, table, model output).}

\item{name}{Character. A descriptive name for this snapshot.}

\item{script_name}{Optional. The name of the script creating the snapshot.
If NULL, attempts to auto-detect from the call stack.}

to update if differences are found.
}
\details{
Snapshots are stored in \code{_resultcheck_snapshots/} directory relative
to the project root, organized by script name.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# In an analysis script:
model <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
snapshot(model, "mtcars_model")

# First time: saves the snapshot
# Later times: compares and prompts to update if different

# For non-interactive use (e.g., in automated tests):
snapshot(model, "mtcars_model", interactive = FALSE)
}
}
