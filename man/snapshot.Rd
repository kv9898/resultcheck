\usage{
snapshot(value, name, script_name = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{value}{The R object to snapshot (e.g., plot, table, model output).}

\item{name}{Character. A descriptive name for this snapshot.}

\item{script_name}{Optional. The name of the script creating the snapshot.
If NULL, attempts to auto-detect from the call stack.}
}
\value{
Invisible TRUE if snapshot matches or was updated.
In testing mode, throws an error if snapshot is missing or doesn't match.
}
\description{
Creates or updates a snapshot of an R object for interactive analysis.
On first use, saves the object to a human-readable snapshot file (.md).
On subsequent uses, compares the current object to the saved snapshot.
}
\details{
In interactive mode (default), prompts the user to update if differences
are found and emits a warning. In testing mode (inside testthat or
run_in_sandbox), throws an error if snapshot doesn't exist or doesn't match.

Snapshots are stored in \code{_resultcheck_snapshots/} directory relative
to the project root, organized by script name.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# In an analysis script (interactive mode):
model <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
snapshot(model, "mtcars_model")

# First time: saves the snapshot
# Later times: compares, shows differences, prompts to update

# In testing mode (inside run_in_sandbox or testthat):
# Errors if snapshot missing or doesn't match
}
}
